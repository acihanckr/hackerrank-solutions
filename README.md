# hackerrank-python-challanges

This repository includes my solutions to the Python challanges from HackerRank website. 
I started the Python files with the code given in the website as the challange,
and added my solution. Some questions included many parts to start with, either related to input,
output handling, or to provide a blueprint for the solution, and some to test the solution code.
To distinguish my code from the code originally given in the challange I used start and end 
words commented before and after my code and if I only needed to add an inline
change then I added an inline comment following the format start - change - end.

Each challange is in its folder with the same (or very close) name 
to the challange name in its website. 

To check the original problems: https://www.hackerrank.com/
Lastly, Kudos to the challange authors.

TODO: 1) Add a unittester to be test the codes in local machine with test cases.
      2) Add test cases generator for the challanges (whenever possible).
